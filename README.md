# Advance Data Visualization
In this project i tried to make a more advance version of data analysis through visualization from the Canada immigration project from before.

# Canada Immigration Dataset
The Canada Immigration Dataset Is a a dataset containing the list of countries, continents, and types of countries that immigrates their citizen to Canada from 1980 to 2013. The purpose of this Advace Data Visualization is to further deepen my understanding of the data through a more advance type of visualization as to provide as much insight. This dataset's attributes consist of Type, Coverage,	OdName,	AREA,	AreaName,	REG,	RegName,	DEV,	DevName, and Years which would be further explained in the analysis. Please note that the WorldMap is an out of topic part where i tried to use the WorldMap to see my University from the map.
